#Learning Journal Day 3   
learning Journal  

I think it would be well worth my time to read through the jquery docs this weekend. It's hard to find the exact thing you need when you don't know where to start looking. The lab today was a good challenge. It definitely showed how new we all are to jquery and how much we need to learn.
