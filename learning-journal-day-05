#Learning Journal Day 5
learning Journal

Handlebars is my new best friend. I love how many new tricks we're learning that make everything so much easier!
my goal this weekend is to read as many docs on jQuery, handlebars, template literal, and any other useful information.
last night I spent a good amount of time reading the docs to figure out how to use icon fonts from devicons and font awesome and although it took
some time it definitely paid off and it's rewarding to know what I'm doing when I'm using them. It's of course always easy just to go back to the lab
and figure out how to basically copy and paste and change things to fit my portfolio but I'd rather read the docs and be able
to pull from my knowledge.
