#Learning Journal Day 10    
learning Journal

the functional programming lab was the most challenging so far. It took about 5 hours for me and my teammate to finish it. it's very rewarding that we were able to get it done. This class has been a lot harder than the 201. in 201 I could easily write the solution code in my head. In 301 it takes a lot more searching to find the answer. I can't wait till this all comes naturally (ish).
